## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Dan Sheppard, often going by either dansheps or just sheps.  I work as a Senior Network Analyst for a public university in Canada.  I volunteer as a NetBox maintainer in my spare time.

## NetBox

When I can, I function as a volunteer maintainer for the NetBox open source project.  I am currently open to work requests for NetBox related plugins.

In addition to that, I have developed a number of plugins for NetBox:

- `netbox-routing` - Device routing plugin for defining routes and routing protocols (Static Routing, BGP, OSPF, EIGRP, IS-IS) in NetBox
- `netbox-config-backup` - Device configuration backup plugin in NetBox
- `netbox-lifecycle` - Device EOS/EOL management plugin in NetBox
- `netbox-zabbix` - Zabbix host management plugin (BETA)
